# Minesweeper

This week we're doing a fun exercise from Hacker Rank:

[Minesweeper](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/practice-test-6/challenges/minesweeper-1)

If you don't want to tackle the solver part of this then you could just make an interactive version of the game,
possibly with configurable difficulty levels.
