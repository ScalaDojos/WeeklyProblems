# Ndom numerals

A common programming exercise is to implement a Roman numeral generator. We're going to do something slightly different

The number system is described here:

Write a decimal to Ndom converter. For bonus points, write an Ndom to decimal converter. And if you're interested in
other numerical systems, there's an excellent list at the same site: [Number Systems of the World](http://www.sf.airnet.ne.jp/ts/language/number.html)
